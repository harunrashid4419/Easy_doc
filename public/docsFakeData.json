        "titleSummury": "An interview is a structured conversation where one participant asks questions, and the other provides answers. In common parlance, the word interview refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee.",
        "question": "Why is preparation important for interview ?",
        "answer": "Being invited to an interview means that your application must have made a good impression. An interview is a discussion between you and an employer to find out if you can do the job. You need to prepare yourself for the interview to make sure that you are successful.",
        "tipsTitle": "10 things you should never do in a job interview",
        "allTips": "1. Be Negetive   It's never a good idea to be critical towards past employers you may have had. Negativity towards previous experiences does not reflect poorly on the organization, but on you. Always be optimistic about past challenges you’ve faced and what you learned from those experiences.   2. Show your nerves   It’s normal to feel nervous during an interview, especially if you’ve been preparing for a while. However coming across as too nervous may be interpreted by the interviewer as you needing to work on the interpersonal skills necessary to thrive in the work environments—be that with other students in the lab or customers for the company. This doesn’t mean you need to be an extrovert—just be confident in yourself and your answers.   3. Lie about anything   It can be tempting to overstate your experience to make you seem more qualified than you are, especially when you feel trapped in a perpetual I need experience to get experience cycle. But exaggerating your qualifications is never a good idea. The risks from doing a job you aren't qualified for is harmful to yourself and others. Some other ways of getting out of this cycle can include volunteering to gain necessary skills, doing workshops, or even taking a course to diversify your skill set!   4. Be arrogant   Don’t get me wrong, it’s important to be confident and enthusiastic during an interview, but appearing arrogant is usually a downfall. There is a fine line between bragging and being confident. No matter how qualified you think you are for the position, nobody owes you the job so stay humble, be respectful, and make sure to thank your interviewer for their time and the opportunity to interview for the position.   5. Dress too casually   While you don’t need to wear a suit and tie to interview at a lab (typically), it's important to present yourself professionally. So no leggings or sweats, no messy hair, and please don’t wear running shoes. How you present yourself reflects on your cleanliness, organization, and work ethic. It shows your interviewer that you're taking this seriously.   6. Show up late   This one speaks for itself. Remember, 10 minutes early is on time. Don’t forget to double-check your interview time and location, and make sure you review how to get there on Google Maps.   7. Leave them hanging   Often at the end of an interview, you'll be asked if you have any questions. Never say (No) This is a great time not only to ask questions about the position and the organization, but also to ask them about the timeline for the (potential) hiring process, reaffirm how qualified and passionate you are, and of course ask any other questions. Don’t forget to thank them for the interview!   8. Display bad body language   Body language is a big reflection of your entire attitude and what you think of the people you're with and the place you're in. Be sure to sit up straight, and make eye contact. Slouching, as well as fiddling around, could show that you’re nervous, uninterested, or arrogant.   9. Forget to do your homework   Make sure you know the position you're applying for through and through. Be ready to talk about how your skills, experience, and attitude fulfill the values and requirements of the position. Make sure you have evidence to back up the fact that you are the one for the job.   10. Ramble on   Although it's important to answer the question with more than one-word responses, rambling on and on for minutes is not recommended. Gather your thoughts and try to articulate them clearly so the interviewer gets the point. Rambling loses their interest and can make them think you don't know what you're talking about. If you feel like you're rambling, stop yourself and ask the interviewer to repeat the question. This will help you get back on track. You could also ask if your response answers their question and they may take the opportunity to elaborate and redirect you."

        "subTitle": "How To Answer the “Tell Me About Yourself” Interview Question",
        "subTitleSummury": "“Tell me about yourself” might seem like an easy win of an interview question—after all, you know all about yourself! And good thing, too, because it’s often the very first thing an interviewer will ask you to do—whether you’re having a preliminary phone screen, speaking to your prospective boss, or sitting down with the CEO during the final round.   But responding to this invitation to talk about yourself in the context of a job interview can feel stressful and complicated. You might be thinking: Um, what do you want to know? Should I give you the biopic synopsis of my workplace drama complete with ideal casting?   Your interviewer doesn’t need to know you envision Zendaya playing you in the imagined movie adaptation of your life. But you can and should prepare in advance so you can use this common opening prompt to your advantage, setting the stage for a successful interview.",
        "question": "Why interviewers ask you to “Tell me about yourself” ?",
        "answer": "As with any interview question, the key to crafting an impressive answer is understanding why people are asking in the first place.   “It lets them ease into the actual interviewing,” says leadership development coach Alina Campos, founder of Rising. “Often when the conversation starts it’s a lot of small talk and it’s a way to transition into it,” especially for less seasoned recruiters or hiring managers. “The interviewee’s nervous but the interviewer’s trying to get their bearings [too].”   This question is also a great starting point that can help inform the direction of the interview, says Muse career coach and BetterWorks Labs founder Al Dea: “Depending on what you say it’s going to help them figure out the next question,” which might help start a chain effect of follow-up questions, lend an easy flow to the conversation, and help recruiters and hiring managers accomplish one of their major goals in the hiring process: getting to know you.   If you answer it well, the interviewers will begin to find out why you’re the best candidate for this job, in terms of hard skills and experience as well as soft skills. It’s a great opportunity to demonstrate that you can communicate clearly and effectively, connect with and react to other humans, and present yourself professionally.",
        "howTitle": "How to answer “Tell me about yourself”",
        "howTitleSummury1": "1. Remember this is often your first impression, and it matters.   “We really only have one chance to make a first impression,” says Muse career coach and recruiter Steven Davis. “My opinion is that most hiring decisions are made in the first minute,” which includes your greeting, handshake, eye contact, and the first thing you say, which may very well be your response to “Tell me about yourself.”   Even if the powers that be aren’t making an irreversible determination shortly after the conversation begins, a first impression can color the rest of the interview. If you have to spend the rest of the time making up for a bad opening, you’re in a very different position than if you gave a succinct, confident, and relevant answer right off the bat.   “Be prepared for this question and show interviewers you prepared for it,” Campos says. “The confidence that comes across in this is a really good place to start from.”   2. Keep it professional.   As you know by now, this question carries an invisible addendum: “as it’s relevant to this role and company.” So you’re best off keeping your answer professional. The norm in some countries might be to share personal details at this point, Wascovich says, but in the U.S. you should avoid talking about your family and hobbies, for instance, unless you know something very specific about the company that would lead you to believe otherwise.   3. Know your audience.   Learning about the company you're interviewing with ahead of time is crucial. You can tailor your answer to focus on where you align with the company culture and be able to ask more informed questions at the end of the interview.   4. Highlight your personality   Mentioning that you quilt or play chess reveals more about you than just what you do in your spare time, it shows a part of your personality. Interactive roles like volunteer work or being a part of a softball team demonstrate that you are friendly and are able to communicate well with others. ",

        "subTitleSummury": "This is a commonly asked question in job interviews – for all levels of positions and in all industries. Even when you’re not asked “What are your strengths?”, you still must be prepared to answer the question well in order to land the job. After all, from the employer’s perspective, the main point of a job interview is to understand what you could do for the organization and why they should hire you instead of someone else. Although this question comes up in 80% of interviews, many candidates don’t know how to answer it. This means there’s a real opportunity for you to stand out from the crowd if you can speak about your strengths in an authentic and compelling way.",
        "question": "Why Do Interviewers Ask This Question?",
        "answer": "It’s the interviewer’s job to find someone who will perform in the position and get along with the team. This question can be phrased in several ways:   Your strengths align with the company’s needs   You can do the job and perform like a rock star   You are the best person for the job — no need to hold out for someone better   You have qualities, skills, and/or experience that set you apart from the competition   You are someone who will make an excellent addition to the team",
        "howTitle": "How to Talk About Your Strengths",
        "howTitleSummury1": "Some people think this is an easy question. This question is a prompt for you to brag and “sell” yourself as the best fit for the job. So how could you mess it up? You know yourself, right? Unfortunately, many candidates don’t have a clear sense of their job-related strengths.",
        "howTitleSummury2": "1. Brainstorm   Sit down and make a personal strengths list — aim for at least 10 and be creative. Jot down everything that comes to mind. You can always delete or modify later.   Your strengths could include:   Experience — Experience with a certain software or type of task, expertise in a particular industry, a track record of working with similar products or clients, etc.   Talents — Abilities such as programming in a desired language, writing proposals, selling widgets, litigating cases, organizing events, translating from Mandarin, etc. (the possibilities here are truly endless).   Soft skills — Competencies such as problem-solving, influencing, team building, negotiation, managing up, etc.   2. Prepare examples   Develop at least one example or interview story to illustrate each of your strengths. If you’re not sure how to go about crafting compelling stories and examples from your previous experience, scroll down to find some examples that work. Having a concise example or story ready to back each strength up is crucial here. Be careful about rambling. Your answer should still be 1-2 minutes long. If you want to share three strengths and back each up with an example, you will want to practice answering interview questions in advance so that you can do it in a concise and effective way.   3. Be accurate, relevant, and show self-awareness   Make sure to choose the strengths that you actually possess and avoid being too generic. Instead of “people skills” (too broad and boring), go with “relationship building” or “persuasive communication.” You should take the time to analyze the job description and identify the most important strengths for each opportunity. You likely have many strengths, but which will be most relevant for this interviewer? Always try to match your strengths with the requirements of the position you’re applying for. A common mistake here is to choose a lame strength that doesn’t really help you stand out. These are either strengths that are hardly relevant to the job at hand or weak strengths that just about anyone could claim. This mistake makes a candidate bland and forgettable at best. At worst, you can raise red flags with the interviewer — who wants to hire someone whose greatest strength is the ability to show up on time?   4. Don’t be too humble   Many candidates are too humble or just aren’t comfortable articulating what makes them great. This is particularly true for introverts and/or people who never really had to “sell” themselves before because new jobs always fell in their laps in the past. You have to get over any hesitation to say nice things about yourself (That’s why practicing your answers is so crucial!). You can do it in a way that feels comfortable and authentic if you prepare in advance.",

        "howTitleSummury2": "1. Show off your skills and experience   The first thing you should do when answering “why should we hire you?” is to highlight any skills and professional experience that are relevant to the position you’re applying for.   To make your answer all the more valid, make sure to always back up everything you say with examples, experiences, and achievements.   2. Highlight your ability to fit in and work in a team   Teamwork skills and adaptability comes in handy for practically every position out there.   No matter your profession, you’ll likely need to work alongside others and adapt to different people and situations, so these are two skills that employers are always on the lookout for.   Even if you’re a novelist - a predominantly solitary profession - you’ll still need to work with your publisher, a team of editors, and book designers to create a good book.

Explain how you can help the company do more   At the end of the day, the goal of every job is to help an organization achieve a certain goal.   If you’re applying for a job in marketing, for example, your goal might be to generate leads. If you’re in customer support, it’s to provide excellent service to the company’s clients   As such, one way to answer “why should we hire you?” is by explaining how, exactly, you can help the company achieve such a goal through your experience and skills.

They want to find someone who can organize events successfully, promote the said events, and improve the company's brand awareness.

There are a number of reasons why you might get one, but fortunately, resolving such an error isn’t too difficult. It’s helpful to know what this error is and why it’s being thrown by the compiler because you’ll save yourself precious debugging time.   In this guide to JavaScript reference errors, you’ll learn how to identify and solve them as well as how to avoid this type of error in the future.",
        "question": "Why You Need to Understand Reference Errors",
        "answer": "It’s important that you understand why JavaScript might throw such an error, especially for the following reasons:   - If you understand what’s going on and why, the error is easier and quicker to fix.   - It is possible to catch this type of error at build time if your code is properly structured.   - If you spend less time trying to understand why the error occurred, you can spend more time on programming, which improves your workflow.",

        "answer":"React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.",
        "allTips":"1. Online Playgrounds   If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation,so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.   2. Add React to a Website   You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.   3. Create a New React App   When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.",

Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.   2. React for Beginners   If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out this overview of React by Tania Rascia. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!   3. React for Designers   If you’re coming from a design background, these resources are a great place to get started.   4. JavaScript Resources   The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time. We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React."

        "howTitleSummury2":"1. Create React App   Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features,provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.   2. Next.js   Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applicationsbuilt with React. It includes styling and routing solutions out of the box, and assumes that you’re using Node.js as the server environment.Learn Next.js from its official guide.   3. Gatsby   Gatsby is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components,but outputs pre-rendered HTML and CSS to guarantee the fastest load time.Learn Gatsby from its official guide and a gallery of starter kits.   4. More Flexible Toolchains   The following toolchains offer more flexibility and choice. We recommend them to more experienced users:   Neutrino combines the power of webpack with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for React apps and React components.Nx is a toolkit for full-stack monorepo development, with built-in support for React, Next.js, Express, and more.   Parcel is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that works with React.Razzle is a server-rendering framework that doesn’t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js."

It corresponds to the latest tag on npm.It is the recommended channel for all React apps that are shipped to real users.If you’re not sure which channel you should use, it’s Latest. If you’re a React developer, this is what you’re already using.You can expect updates to Latest to be extremely stable.Versions follow the semanticversioning scheme. Learn more about our commitment to stability and incremental migration in our versioning policy.   2. Next Channel   The Next channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository.We use prereleases in the Next channel as release candidates for the Latest channel. You canthink of Next as a superset of Latest that is updated more frequently.The degree of change between the most recent Next release and the most recent Latestrelease is approximately the same as you would find between two minor semver releases.However, the Next channel does not conform to semantic versioning. You should expect occasional breaking changes between successive releases in the Next channel.   3. Experimental Channel   Like Next, the Experimental channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository. Unlike Next, Experimental releases include additional features and APIs that are not ready for wider release. Usually, an update to Next is accompanied by a corresponding update to Experimental. They are based on the same source revision, but are built using a different set of feature flags."
