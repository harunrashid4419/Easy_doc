            "heading": "10 things you should never do in a job interview",
            "list": "1. Be Negetive   It's never a good idea to be critical towards past employers you may have had. Negativity towards previous experiences does not reflect poorly on the organization, but on you. Always be optimistic about past challenges you’ve faced and what you learned from those experiences.   2. Show your nerves   It’s normal to feel nervous during an interview, especially if you’ve been preparing for a while. However coming across as too nervous may be interpreted by the interviewer as you needing to work on the interpersonal skills necessary to thrive in the work environments—be that with other students in the lab or customers for the company. This doesn’t mean you need to be an extrovert—just be confident in yourself and your answers.   3. Lie about anything   It can be tempting to overstate your experience to make you seem more qualified than you are, especially when you feel trapped in a perpetual I need experience to get experience cycle. But exaggerating your qualifications is never a good idea. The risks from doing a job you aren't qualified for is harmful to yourself and others. Some other ways of getting out of this cycle can include volunteering to gain necessary skills, doing workshops, or even taking a course to diversify your skill set!   4. Be arrogant   Don’t get me wrong, it’s important to be confident and enthusiastic during an interview, but appearing arrogant is usually a downfall. There is a fine line between bragging and being confident. No matter how qualified you think you are for the position, nobody owes you the job so stay humble, be respectful, and make sure to thank your interviewer for their time and the opportunity to interview for the position.   5. Dress too casually   While you don’t need to wear a suit and tie to interview at a lab (typically), it's important to present yourself professionally. So no leggings or sweats, no messy hair, and please don’t wear running shoes. How you present yourself reflects on your cleanliness, organization, and work ethic. It shows your interviewer that you're taking this seriously.   6. Show up late   This one speaks for itself. Remember, 10 minutes early is on time. Don’t forget to double-check your interview time and location, and make sure you review how to get there on Google Maps.   7. Leave them hanging   Often at the end of an interview, you'll be asked if you have any questions. Never say (No) This is a great time not only to ask questions about the position and the organization, but also to ask them about the timeline for the (potential) hiring process, reaffirm how qualified and passionate you are, and of course ask any other questions. Don’t forget to thank them for the interview!   8. Display bad body language   Body language is a big reflection of your entire attitude and what you think of the people you're with and the place you're in. Be sure to sit up straight, and make eye contact. Slouching, as well as fiddling around, could show that you’re nervous, uninterested, or arrogant.   9. Forget to do your homework   Make sure you know the position you're applying for through and through. Be ready to talk about how your skills, experience, and attitude fulfill the values and requirements of the position. Make sure you have evidence to back up the fact that you are the one for the job.   10. Ramble on   Although it's important to answer the question with more than one-word responses, rambling on and on for minutes is not recommended. Gather your thoughts and try to articulate them clearly so the interviewer gets the point. Rambling loses their interest and can make them think you don't know what you're talking about. If you feel like you're rambling, stop yourself and ask the interviewer to repeat the question. This will help you get back on track. You could also ask if your response answers their question and they may take the opportunity to elaborate and redirect you."

But responding to this invitation to talk about yourself in the context of a job interview can feel stressful and complicated. You might be thinking: Um, what do you want to know?

Your interviewer doesn’t need to know you envision Zendaya playing you in the imagined movie adaptation of your life.

                    "answer": "As with any interview question, the key to crafting an impressive answer is understanding why people are asking in the first place.   “It lets them ease into the actual interviewing,” says leadership development coach Alina Campos, founder of Rising. “Often when the conversation starts it’s a lot of small talk and it’s a way to transition into it,” especially for less seasoned recruiters or hiring managers. “The interviewee’s nervous but the interviewer’s trying to get their bearings [too].”   This question is also a great starting point that can help inform the direction of the interview, says Muse career coach and BetterWorks Labs founder Al Dea: “Depending on what you say it’s going to help them figure out the next question,” which might help start a chain effect of follow-up questions, lend an easy flow to the conversation, and help recruiters and hiring managers accomplish one of their major goals in the hiring process: getting to know you.   If you answer it well, the interviewers will begin to find out why you’re the best candidate for this job, in terms of hard skills and experience as well as soft skills. It’s a great opportunity to demonstrate that you can communicate clearly and effectively, connect with and react to other humans, and present yourself professionally."

                    "heading": "4 more tips for answering “Tell me about yourself”",
                    "answer": "1. Remember this is often your first impression, and it matters.   “We really only have one chance to make a first impression,” says Muse career coach and recruiter Steven Davis. “My opinion is that most hiring decisions are made in the first minute,” which includes your greeting, handshake, eye contact, and the first thing you say, which may very well be your response to “Tell me about yourself.”   Even if the powers that be aren’t making an irreversible determination shortly after the conversation begins, a first impression can color the rest of the interview. If you have to spend the rest of the time making up for a bad opening, you’re in a very different position than if you gave a succinct, confident, and relevant answer right off the bat.   “Be prepared for this question and show interviewers you prepared for it,” Campos says. “The confidence that comes across in this is a really good place to start from.”   2. Keep it professional.   As you know by now, this question carries an invisible addendum: “as it’s relevant to this role and company.” So you’re best off keeping your answer professional. The norm in some countries might be to share personal details at this point, Wascovich says, but in the U.S. you should avoid talking about your family and hobbies, for instance, unless you know something very specific about the company that would lead you to believe otherwise.   3. Know your audience.   Learning about the company you're interviewing with ahead of time is crucial. You can tailor your answer to focus on where you align with the company culture and be able to ask more informed questions at the end of the interview.   4. Highlight your personality   Mentioning that you quilt or play chess reveals more about you than just what you do in your spare time, it shows a part of your personality. Interactive roles like volunteer work or being a part of a softball team demonstrate that you are friendly and are able to communicate well with others. "

                    "heading": "Here is some Example for you",
                    "answer": "Example Answer #1   I began my career as an administrative assistant working for my current company, but I quickly branched out into marketing. I've always had this way of making better sense of why people need and desire products and services. You could say that I have a knack for understanding the psychology of customers, and using that to point to their needs and specific pain points. I used these skills to advance in my company, making it all the way to marketing director. My goal is to continue to progress in my career.   Example Answer #2   I'd be glad to share a little about myself. I graduated from XYZ University, where I majored in business administration. During my time at the school I had an internship at a large Fortune 500 company, where I was able to take an active role in their Human Resources department, receiving excellent career advice from mentors. I continued on at that company, up until my current job.   One of the things that I spearheaded at the company was creating a holistic view of employee care. I helped add to the company culture by creating initiatives to create a sense of community, even when we were working remotely. I've sensed that my major passion is to foster a sense of community among employees. My wife and kids have even mentioned how good I am about including them in games and activities. I believe I’m the ideal candidate, as I am passionate about helping you to continue the great work you're doing in human resources.   Example Answer #3   Throughout my entire career, I have been driven by learning new skills and finding innovative ways to complete my duties. I've always been an avid reader, and consider myself to be a go-getter when it comes to discovering new things. Recently, in the last 5 years, I taught myself how to code, and from there I have had a steady career in the IT field. I have grown leaps and bounds in my technical skills, and this is because I am a lifelong learner who is always willing to humble myself to learn something new."

You know yourself, right? Unfortunately, many candidates don’t have a clear sense of their job-related strengths.",
                    "answer": "1. Brainstorm   Sit down and make a personal strengths list — aim for at least 10 and be creative. Jot down everything that comes to mind. You can always delete or modify later.   Your strengths could include:   Experience — Experience with a certain software or type of task, expertise in a particular industry, a track record of working with similar products or clients, etc.   Talents — Abilities such as programming in a desired language, writing proposals, selling widgets, litigating cases, organizing events, translating from Mandarin, etc. (the possibilities here are truly endless).   Soft skills — Competencies such as problem-solving, influencing, team building, negotiation, managing up, etc.   2. Prepare examples   Develop at least one example or interview story to illustrate each of your strengths. If you’re not sure how to go about crafting compelling stories and examples from your previous experience, scroll down to find some examples that work. Having a concise example or story ready to back each strength up is crucial here. Be careful about rambling. Your answer should still be 1-2 minutes long. If you want to share three strengths and back each up with an example, you will want to practice answering interview questions in advance so that you can do it in a concise and effective way.   3. Be accurate, relevant, and show self-awareness   Make sure to choose the strengths that you actually possess and avoid being too generic. Instead of “people skills” (too broad and boring), go with “relationship building” or “persuasive communication.” You should take the time to analyze the job description and identify the most important strengths for each opportunity. You likely have many strengths, but which will be most relevant for this interviewer? Always try to match your strengths with the requirements of the position you’re applying for. A common mistake here is to choose a lame strength that doesn’t really help you stand out. These are either strengths that are hardly relevant to the job at hand or weak strengths that just about anyone could claim. This mistake makes a candidate bland and forgettable at best. At worst, you can raise red flags with the interviewer — who wants to hire someone whose greatest strength is the ability to show up on time?   4. Don’t be too humble   Many candidates are too humble or just aren’t comfortable articulating what makes them great. This is particularly true for introverts and/or people who never really had to “sell” themselves before because new jobs always fell in their laps in the past. You have to get over any hesitation to say nice things about yourself (That’s why practicing your answers is so crucial!). You can do it in a way that feels comfortable and authentic if you prepare in advance."

Show off your skills and experience   The first thing you should do when answering “why should we hire you?” is to highlight any skills and professional experience that are relevant to the position you’re applying for.   To make your answer all the more valid, make sure to always back up everything you say with examples, experiences, and achievements.   2. Highlight your ability to fit in and work in a team   Teamwork skills and adaptability comes in handy for practically every position out there.   No matter your profession, you’ll likely need to work alongside others and adapt to different people and situations, so these are two skills that employers are always on the lookout for.   Even if you’re a novelist - a predominantly solitary profession - you’ll still need to work with your publisher, a team of editors, and book designers to create a good book.   So, convincing the interviewer that you can adapt to the work environment, your colleagues, and even your supervisors, is an important part of answering “why should we hire you?”   3. Explain how you can help the company do more   At the end of the day, the goal of every job is to help an organization achieve a certain goal.   If you’re applying for a job in marketing, for example, your goal might be to generate leads. If you’re in customer support, it’s to provide excellent service to the company’s clients   As such, one way to answer “why should we hire you?” is by explaining how, exactly, you can help the company achieve such a goal through your experience and skills.   Let’s say that you’re applying for a role as an event planner at a small company. From reading the job description, you know they’re looking for someone to organize events in their area and get the company’s name out there.   Now you have a clear understanding of what the company’s #1 goal in hiring you is! They want to find someone who can organize events successfully, promote the said events, and improve the company's brand awareness.   Now, when answering “why should we hire you,” you can explain how exactly you’ll be able to fulfill the company's goals."
